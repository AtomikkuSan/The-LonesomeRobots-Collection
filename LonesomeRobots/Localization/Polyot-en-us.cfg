		#LonesomeRobots-Polyot_Warhead-titl = Polyot Science Payload
		#LonesomeRobots-Polyot_Warhead-desc = Initially designed as an explosive warhead for destroying rival satellites and space stations, now it is used for science. If you have SCANsat installed it will work as a RADAR altimetry sensor. Also contains a gravity sensor and experiment, a temperature sensor and experiment, as well as a Mystery Goo experiment. Now if you slam it hard enough on a satellite or space station it will probably also do the job it was initially designed for, despite of the explosives missing.
